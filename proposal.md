## Proposal
Website scraper that collects bootstrap components: names and html markup from [Getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) and stores them in my custom [Bootstrap API](http://bootstrap-api.sportbook.anasbellouzi.studio/).

### Why
[Bootstrap API](ap-api.sportbook.anasbellouzi.studio) is a custom API that I made that serves as a cloud storage for my primary project [Web.io](https://anbellouzi.github.io/web.io/), a voice recognition website builder built in node.js
