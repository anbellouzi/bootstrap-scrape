# ðŸ”— Bootstrap Web Scraper

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/anbellouzi/bootstrap-scrape)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/anbellouzi/bootstrap-scrape)


## Project Structure

```bash
ðŸ“‚ bootstrap-scrape
â”œâ”€â”€ proposal.md
â”œâ”€â”€ components.txt
â””â”€â”€ scrape.go
```

## Proposal
Website scraper that collects bootstrap components: names and html markup from [!getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) and stores them in my custom [!bootstrap API](http://bootstrap-api.sportbook.anasbellouzi.studio/).

### Why
[!bootstrap API](ap-api.sportbook.anasbellouzi.studio) is a custom API that I made that serves as a cloud storage for my primary project [!web.io](https://anbellouzi.github.io/web.io/), a voice recognition website builder built in node.js
